	<h3>The History of Books</h3>

	<p>3500 BC - Symbols onto tablets: "The first ever symbols put on a moveable object were from a group of southern Mesopotamian people called the Sumarians. They had a "cuneiform" alphabet, and they wrote the symbols on clay tablets with a stylus called a "Calamus". The Sumarians had the earliest known alphabet in the world."</p>
	<p>2400 B.C. - Earlier Surviving Papyrus Scrolls: "Scrolls, made of the thick paper material Papyrus, that contained written words date all the way back to 2400 BC, from Egypt. Some historians believe that papyrus could have been invented as early as 3100 B.C. Egyptains used papyrus before the Greeks or Romans adopted the use of it. they stored their books rolled up into wooden tubes, and glued together lots of scrolls to make very long pages." </p>
	<p>500-200 B.C- The Invention of Parchment: "As opposed to the plant-based papyrus, people began writing on parchment made from thinned out animal skins. The word "parhment" comes from the name of the Greek town that perfected it, Pergamon. After the over-farming of papyrus reeds, parchment became the main writing material."</p>
	<p>200 B.C. - Wax Tablets: "Invented by the Romans, these blocks of wood had wax on the inside of them that one could make an impression on using a stylus, and this innovation of a book allowed for words to be erased and re-written. These were sometimes bound together with string or cordto keep "pages" together like an early version of the ringed binder."</p>
	<p>105 AD- Paper: It is widely believed that a Chinese eunuch called Cai Lun invented the process of paper making. It involves mixing together fibers in water, forming a suspension, and then allowing this suspension to dry in a screen so it has a flat shape and is easy to write on. Every piece of paper was a standard size, and called a leaf.</p>
	<p>295 AD - Library of Alexandria is Created: "the Library of Alexandria is made, containing ancient scrolls and books."</p>
	<p>400-600 AD- Illustrations Added to Books:Early illustrations were still made on parchment as opposed to the more modern paper due to the better quality and strength of parchment. These books were handwritten and decorated with bright colors, intricate designs, and even silver and gold.</p>
	<p> 2007 AD - The Kindle:"The invention of the kndle offered ways to store thousands of books digitally and gave you the ability to have many many books with you at one time without the weight."</p>

	<h3> Why I Love Books </h3>

	<ul>
		<li>I love the smell of books. </li>
		<li> In my last college I was in the LTA associates degree and we took trips to other libraries and I was so in love will how each library organized everything. Look at our library at Dominican they changed our entire library and I love it so much more. I can be sitting at the desk and I can see everyone from my spot in the middle of the room. </li
		<li> I can't decide when I like better a Kindle or a physically book. At this time using a the kindle app on my phone is a lot easier if I have to leave to go out or to work. It's a toss up I occasionally like to hold a physical book. </p>
