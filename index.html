<h1> Books</h1>
<p> I am putting my perspective on books</p>
<h4>Why I started reading in the first place</h4>
<u1> When I was younger I hated reading but as life has tricky situations I didn’t want to be in my life. I turned to books and wanted to go in to that world that's fictional and into fun, happy life rather than my own. I agree with J.K. Rowlings quote (on the bottom of this site) My first thoughts were I didn’t like to read I thought it was boring because I read the wrong books like boring ones or textbook but when you find the right book. The world of books opens to you. Example; Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. My first I started reading was. Harry Potter that become my love for Harry Potter. I have read all of the Harry Potter books at least 3 times each. After reading these books I wanted to read more and it has been non stop ever since. </ul>

<h3> My Little Free Library </h3>
<u1> I call it my little library. I collect books depending on the books. Even thought I have a kindle and I don’t need to keep collecting books. I like the feeling of a book in my hand. the weight and the smell. I love he smell of books. I always find new books from second hand shops. I think I am always going to want to collect books. I also collect movies, key chains. I am a collector but least its not junk items. When I moved in to Dominican I knew I wanted to bring books to school with me to read if I ever had time. I have lived at school since August 28. I wanted to bring some books but not all of mine that are at home. I picked mostly series of books hat I can read. I also picked my Harry Potter books since my room theme is Harry Potter. </u1>
<u2> I decide that I am going to buy a Little Free Library for in front of my parents house. I have thought about this and I feel that this would be really cool to do since my parents live right next to a school. This could also start my library career. </u2>
<h3> Kindle </h3>
<u1> I own a Amazon Kindle. I only had an Amazon Kindle so I can’t which is better but I know that I really love mine. I had my kindle for many years. My kindle is super old and can’t live off the charger. Amazon has a Kindle App so I have that on my phone and computer. I love it. I can have read hundreds of books with the click of my finger. I have four hundred and thirty-four books on my kindle. I have read one hundred and thirty-seven. Two hundred and ninety-seven books unread and out of four hundred and thirty-four. Three hundred and forty-six books that I own and eighty-eight books that I have samples for. </u1>
