		<h3>History of the library</h3>

		<p>The Middle Ages and the Renaissance-The role of the European monasteries</p>

		<p>"As European monastic communities were set up (from as early as the 2nd century AD), books were found to be essential to the spiritual life. The rule laid down for observance by several monastic orders enjoined the use of books: that of the Benedictine order, especially, recognized the importance of reading and study, making mention of a “library” and its use under the supervision of a precentor, one of whose duties was to issue the books and take daily inventory of them. Scriptoria, the places where manuscripts were copied out, were a common feature of the monasteries—again, especially in those of the Benedictine order, where there was a strict obligation to preserve manuscripts by copying them. Many—Monte Cassino (529) and Bobbio (614) in Italy; Luxeuil (c. 550) in France; Reichenau (724), Fulda (744), and Corvey (822) in Germany; Canterbury (597), Wearmouth (674), and Jarrow (681) in England—became famous for the production of copies. Rules were laid down for the use of books, and curses invoked against any person who made off with them. Books were, however, lent to other monasteries and even to the secular public against security. In this sense, the monasteries to some extent performed the function of public libraries."</p>

		<p> Rome </p>
		<p>"There were many private libraries in classical Rome, including that of Cicero. Indeed, it became highly fashionable to own a library, judging from the strictures of the moralizing statesman Seneca and the spiteful jibes by the poet Lucian on the uncultured “book clown.” Excavations at both Rome and Herculaneum have revealed what were undoubtedly library rooms in private houses, one at Herculaneum being fitted with bookcases around the walls. A Roman statesman and general, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who was reckoned one of the richest men in the Roman world at that time and was famous for his luxurious way of life, acquired as part of his war booty an enormous library, which he generously put at the disposal of those who were interested. His biographer, Plutarch, speaks appreciatively of the quality of his book collection, and Cicero tells of visiting the library to borrow a book and finding his friend Cato ensconced there surrounded by books of the Stoic philosophy.Julius Caesar planned a public library and entrusted the implementation of his plans to an outstanding scholar and writer, Marcus Terentius Varro, also the author of a treatise on libraries, De bibliothecis (which has not survived). Caesar died before his plans were carried out, but a public library was built within five years by the literary patron Asinius Pollio. Describing its foundation in his Natural History, Pliny coined a striking phrase that has application to libraries generally: ingenia hominum rem publicam fecit (“He made men’s talents a public possession”). Libraries were also set up by Tiberius, Vespasian, Trajan, and many of the later emperors; the Bibliotheca Ulpia, which was established by Trajan about AD 100 and continued until the 5th century, was also the Public Record Office of Rome."</p>

		<h3> Why enjoy I Libraries</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Theyre are three different kinds of libraries; Public Library, Academic Library, and a Public Library</li>
			<li> In my last college I was in the LTA associates degree and we took trips to other libraries and I was so in love will how each library organized everything. Look at our library at Dominican they changed our entire library and I love it so much more. I can be sitting at the desk and I can see everyone from my spot in the middle of the room. </li>
			<li>I enjoy the library because I feel at home so comforable in libraries. It's Home.</li>
			<li>Did you know how quiet the library at Dominican. Our library used to be load and crazy and fun now it quiet and lonely. Our hours of the library used to be last year 8am-12pm. Students would be in the library all the time doing homework or relaxing. Before Thangiving our hours used to be 8am-8pm while after thangiving our hours shortered due to lower amount of student workers. The hours are 8am-5pm. </li>
			<li> I have decided a few months ago that I want to buy/build a Little Free Library. This goes along with my third website. I want to give children free books and I like that you have to put a book in to take a book out. I am also excited to stamp all of my books I have this kit and I will stamp each of my books. </li>
